How to get Pi-Hole up and running in a container under Ubuntu 18.04 with Docker.

This could work just as easy without the network steps on other Linux distro's

If you have Ubuntu 17 or higher then you'll need to disable dnsmasq using the following  commands.

Disable and stop the service 
sudo systemctl disable systemd-resolved.service
sudo systemctl stop systemd-resolved

Then put the following line in the [main] section of your
/etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf
dns=default

Delete the symlink /etc/resolv.conf
rm /etc/resolv.conf

Restart network-manager
sudo service network-manager restart

once that's done you should be able to run the pihole docker image without issues.  The following commands worked OK for me but you can find full list of option on https://hub.docker.com/r/pihole/pihole

sudo docker pull pihole/pihole

sudo docker run -d \
    --name pihole \
    -p 53:53/tcp -p 53:53/udp \
    -p 67:67/udp \
    -p 80:80 \
    -p 443:443 \
    -v "${DOCKER_CONFIGS}/pihole/:/etc/pihole/" \
    -v "${DOCKER_CONFIGS}/dnsmasq.d/:/etc/dnsmasq.d/" \
    -e ServerIP="${IP}" \
    -e ServerIPv6="${IPv6}" \
    --restart=unless-stopped \
    --cap-add=NET_ADMIN \
    --dns=127.0.0.1 --dns=1.1.1.1 \
    pihole/pihole:latest

echo -n "Your password for https://${IP}/admin/ is "
docker logs pihole 2** /dev/null | grep 'password'
